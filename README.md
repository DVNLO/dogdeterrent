# dogdeterrent
A recipe for a dog deterrent solution. 

# recipe

The recipe can be described by the following system of equations. 

v_i + v_a + v_w = v_t
v_i = 1/5 v_t
v_a + v_w = 4/5 v_t
v_a = 2 v_w

where:
v_i is the volume of isopropyl alchol,
v_a is the volume of apple cider vinegar,
v_w is the volume of white vinegar, and 
v_t is the total volume of the solution. 

This system achieves a 20% by volume solution of isopropyl alcohol and 80% by volume solution of vinegars.

# known v_t

When a total volume, v_t, is known we can manipulate the system to solve for v_i,  v_a, and v_w.

v_i = 1/5 v_t
v_w = 4/15 v_t
v_a = 8/15 v_t

## example

Suppose we wanted to fill a 25 fluid ounce spray bottle with dogdeterrent. We can mix

v_i = 1/5 v_t = 1/5 * 25 = 5 fluid ounces of isopropyl alcohol,
v_w = 4/15 v_t = 4/15 * 25 = 20/3 ~ 6.7 fluid ounces of white vinegar, and
v_a = 8/15 v_t = 8/15 * 25 = 40/3 ~ 13.3 fluid ounces of apple cider vinegar

to form the dogdeterrent solution.
